Hi I am Aditya Palve!
A 3rd year Computer Science student at the University Of Bristol. 

I love hacking on random stuff as my past time.
Been primarily coding in Python lately, but I have experience of some shape or form in Java, C, Haskell and Web dev.
Playing around with interpreters recently.

Interested in most things if not all...
